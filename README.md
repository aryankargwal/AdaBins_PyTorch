# AdaBins: A PyTorch Implementation

An easy to use implementation of the [Adabins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14141) by Bhat et al.
This effort was undertaken under [SRM-MIC](https://github.com/srm-mic)'s 'ResCon' event.

You can access the demo notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aryankargwal/AdaBins_PyTorch/blob/main/Adabins_Inference_example.ipynb) if the [GitHub](https://github.com/aryankargwal/AdaBins_PyTorch/blob/main/Adabins_Inference_example.ipynb) does not open.

More documentation to be added.
